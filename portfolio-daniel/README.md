# Portfolio Daniel 🎓🚀
The first time I said "oh, *this is beautiful*" for a frontend project of mine 🎉

In this study project I have managed to develop an almost-professional personal portfolio using pure CSS and HTML, featuring a beautiful *modern design*. By that time I didn't know anything about *backend*, so the form was just a static page.
- Not a real portfolio: Just for studying sake 📚
