# To-do List (Vite and Typescript) 🎓🚀
My first "*Hello World*" in `Typescript` and `React Vite` 🎉

First time I have managed to develop a full application using Typescript, a "Hello World" To-do list, with the help of my friend and teacher [**Cadu Olegario**](https://github.com/CaduOlegario).
They say every beginner needs to do at least 2 unuseful To-do Lists before they can start doing something useful, so here it is 😂
