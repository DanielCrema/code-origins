# My Beginner Memorial 🎓🚀
#### The first "Hello Worlds" through my career 🎉

    This repository contains the first projects I made during my studies. It's a collection of my first steps in the world of programming.  

    As every beginner, I obviously didn't use to commit all my code for not considering it relevant and therefore lost a lot of them. Anyways, this is my memorial, and I hope to come back here in 10 years and cry tears of joy 🥲

- Each `subfolder` in this repository contains a project I have developed through my beginner journey.

- Each `README.md` in each subfolder contains a brief description of the project.

- The subfolders contain the original `.git` files renamed as `original-.git` to avoid conflicts. One may rename them back to `.git` if they wish to see the commit histories.

- Most of the `original repositories` on Github have been deleted or are private, for the sake of cleaning.

## Purpose 🧠
- `Memorial`:  

    - Most experienced programmers regret not having their first projects archive. I don't want to be one of them.

- `Reference`:  

    - Recruiters don't have time to go through boring, old, unorganized and unuseful repositories.  
    I'm making it easy for them to find what they need.

- `Inspiration`:  

    - I hope this initiative inspire starters to well-organize their studying projects with README.mds and commit properly.  
    Beginners often think their trashy projects doesn't worth it, and end up regretting the abscence of records of their history.
