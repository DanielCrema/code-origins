# Maha-Express App 🎓🚀
#### First time I have developed a professional thing 🎉

First time I have managed to develop a full Next.js application for a **real customer**, a simple website for marketing purposes.
**Maha-Express** is a delivery enterprise based in **Sacramento, Brazil**, its owner is a friend of mine and has given me the opportunity to set up a website for them.
I am authorized to share this content by Maha-Express and its associates.
