# Javascalc 🎓🚀
#### My first "Hello World" integrating HTML, CSS and Javascript 🎉

First time I have managed to develop a full HTML/CSS/JS application, a "Hello World" calculator named Javascalc.
- Ugly, unuseful, and probably not very efficient, but still I love it ❤️
- It was probably the most confusing code I have ever written, and to this day it still has bugs. Anyways, I am proud of the result and the persistence I had to do it when I was just an aspirant HTML writer.
